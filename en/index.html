      <div class="project-box">
        <strong>StarWright's Eye (Cosmoteer Tool)</strong>
        <p>A tool for Cosmoteer currently under development, which allows for detailed analysis of ship designs directly from the <code>.ship.png</code> files. The key lies in the method Cosmoteer uses to store ship data and how "StarWright's Eye" makes this data accessible:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Steganography in PNGs:</strong> Cosmoteer embeds ship data not obviously, but directly into the pixels of the <code>.ship.png</code> image files using steganography.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> The tool reads these embedded binary data from the color channels of the image pixels.</li>
          <li><strong>Processing Chain:</strong> The extracted data, which is in a proprietary binary format, is first decompressed using GZip. Subsequently, this binary data is converted into a readable format (similar to JSON) to enable the identification and counting of individual ship modules.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Further details on the analysis functions and features of "StarWright's Eye" will be announced at a later date.</p>
